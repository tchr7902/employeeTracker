# Employee Tracker

## Description

This application was built in order to create a database, as well as interact with its contents. I built this project in order to teach me how to use sql, queries, connecting to a database, how to write asynchronous functions, and overall how to interact with data. This application brings simplicity to employee information management, and is a good start to a potentially large database for employees.
